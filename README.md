# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is part of hack days of holberton, is about building a Tic-Tac-Toe in different programming languajes, in this case R and REBOL

## How to write a Tic Tac Toe in R language?
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R.
R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, …) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to participation in that activity.

## How to write a Tic Tac Toe in rebol language?
Rebol (/ˈrɛbəl/ REB-əl; historically REBOL) is a cross-platform data exchange language and a multi-paradigm dynamic programming language designed by Carl Sassenrath for network communications and distributed computing. It introduces the concept of dialecting: small, optimized, domain-specific languages for code and data, which is also the most notable property of the language according to its designer Carl Sassenrath.

Rebol was initially an acronym for Relative Expression Based Object Language written in all caps.
